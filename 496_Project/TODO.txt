Model Suggestions:

Here are some potential data models for your project that investigate the correlation between college basketball statistics, combine metrics, and the likelihood of a player earning a rookie extension:

---

### **1. Logistic Regression (Baseline)**
   - **Use Case:** Predicts the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., earning a rookie extension or not).
   - **Features:**
     - College stats: Points per game, assists, rebounds, shooting percentages, turnovers, etc.
     - Combine metrics: Lane agility, sprint speed, vertical jump, bench press, etc.
   - **Why It Works:** Provides a simple interpretable baseline model to identify which features (metrics or stats) have the highest influence on success.

---

### **2. Random Forest (Feature Importance)**
   - **Use Case:** Non-linear model that handles interactions between variables well and highlights feature importance.
   - **Features:** Same as logistic regression but with flexibility to include more nuanced data like:
     - Contextual stats (e.g., per-40-minute production, usage rates).
     - Draft position or team data as potential predictors.
   - **Why It Works:** Helps to determine which variables have the greatest predictive power without assuming linear relationships.

---

### **3. Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.)**
   - **Use Case:** For highly imbalanced datasets, gradient boosting models are robust and often outperform other models for binary classification tasks.
   - **Features:** Same as above, with added ability to tune hyperparameters for performance.
   - **Why It Works:** Captures subtle patterns and interactions in the data that might otherwise be missed.

---

### **4. Neural Networks**
   - **Use Case:** If you have a large dataset and want to model complex interactions between college stats and combine metrics.
   - **Features:**
     - All available player metrics and stats.
     - Encode categorical variables (e.g., positions, schools, draft year) using one-hot encoding.
   - **Why It Works:** Neural networks can capture non-linear and high-dimensional relationships, but they require significant data for training.

---

### **5. Cluster Analysis (Exploratory)**
   - **Use Case:** Group players based on similarities in their stats and metrics to identify patterns (e.g., clusters of players likely to earn extensions).
   - **Features:**
     - Combine college performance stats and athletic metrics.
     - Include positional data to group by roles.
   - **Why It Works:** Unsupervised learning can reveal hidden structures in the data that may inform feature engineering or model design.

---

### **6. Ensemble Models**
   - **Use Case:** Combine predictions from logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting to improve robustness.
   - **Features:** Same as above.
   - **Why It Works:** By leveraging the strengths of multiple models, ensemble methods often improve prediction accuracy.

---

### **Key Considerations:**
1. **Handling Imbalanced Data:** Since only a small fraction of players earn rookie extensions, consider oversampling, undersampling, or using techniques like SMOTE.
2. **Position-Specific Models:** Build separate models for guards, forwards, and centers to account for differences in skillsets and athletic requirements.
3. **Threshold Sensitivity Analysis:** Experiment with different contract value thresholds for defining "success" (e.g., $5M vs. $10M).
4. **Validation Strategy:** Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well across different subsets of data.
